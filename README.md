# Hello, I'm Pallabi 👋

- Mathematics 🧮
- Algorithmics 🧩
- Quantum Computer Science 🌌
- Ontology 🌌

## Some facts about me
🎓 I recently completed my bachelor's thesis, the code of which you can find [here](https://github.com/pujiii/rp-code).

🚀 I have experience working with and love the game engine [**LÖVE2D**](https://love2d.org/), where I have created some tile-based games for friends, as well as a larger. Unfortunately I cannot share these as I used a bunch of copyrighted material 😔

💬 My favorite programming language is **Lua** because I find its syntax incredibly cute and enjoyable to work with. I don't use it much though, I just like it :)
